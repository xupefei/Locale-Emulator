You can submit an issue if any application is not working (but you think should work) with Locale Emulator. Before submitting, please turn-off your antivirus and protection software and try again.

## Feature Request ##

You can also submit an issue if you have some wonderful ideas to improve Locale Emulator. Then I *may* accept it because I want to make Locale Emulator *small*. So if your idea is to add automatic translation function to Locale Emulator, please fork this repo and do it yourself.
